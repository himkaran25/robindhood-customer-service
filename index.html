    <h2>1. In-App Support (Preferred Method)</h2>
    <p>Robinhood encourages users to contact support through the mobile app or website. Follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Robinhood app.</li>
      <li>Tap the <strong>Account</strong> icon (person icon) in the bottom-right corner.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Help</strong>.</li>
      <li>Tap <strong>Contact Us</strong>.</li>
      <li>Choose the topic you're having trouble with and follow the prompts to request support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Request a Call</h2>
    <p>You can request a phone call from Robinhood through the app or website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the same steps as above until you reach the support topic.</li>
      <li>Look for the option to request a phone call.</li>
      <li>Robinhood will typically call you back within a few minutes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Email Support</h2>
    <p>Although not the fastest method, you can send an email through their website:</p>
    <p>Visit the <a href="https://robinhood.com/contact" target="_blank">Robinhood Contact Page</a> and fill out the appropriate form for your issue.</p>

    <h2>4. Help Center</h2>
    <p>Robinhood's <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/" target="_blank">Help Center</a> has hundreds of articles and answers to common questions. It’s the best place to start if you want fast answers without waiting for support.</p>

    <h2>5. Social Media (Not for Account Help)</h2>
    <p>Robinhood maintains official profiles on platforms like Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp" target="_blank">@RobinhoodApp</a>) and Facebook. While they do respond to general inquiries, they won’t help with account-specific issues for privacy reasons.</p>

    <h2>6. No Public Phone Number</h2>
    <p>Robinhood does not offer a direct phone number for inbound calls. All phone support must be requested through the app or website.</p>

    <h2>Final Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure your app is up to date before contacting support.</li>
      <li>Provide accurate information and screenshots (if applicable) to speed up the process.</li>
      <li>Be cautious of scams—Robinhood will never ask for your password or verification codes via phone or email.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're locked out or experiencing a time-sensitive issue, contact them through the app immediately and request a callback.</p>

    <p>We hope this guide helps you reach Robinhood support quickly and easily.</p>
